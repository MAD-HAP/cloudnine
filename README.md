### Document Management System

- Google or Github OAuth verified users can upload files to cloud and manage access rules.
- Invite members by their username and define their access rights to read/write/delete that file.
- Sync data in real-time for seamless sharing experience.


## Out-of-the-box features

- Compression of file using algorithms such as Huffman Algorithm.
- Chunking of the file and parallel upload of chunks for increased speed.
- Create groups and invite members to instantly share a file with pre-defined methods.
- Ability for verification of invited member using face recognition to avoid data leak.
